*Introduction

This is a collection of sample scripts and tools for APIC-EM.

is particularly useful for authentication and asychronous requests, where a taskId is returned.

**sample_code:  

contains some sample scripts to talk to sandboxapic.  There are examples for Plug-and-Play (PNP), inventory and EasyQoS (EQ).
