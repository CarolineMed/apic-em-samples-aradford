# APIC-EM Sample Scripts

This directory contains some sample Python scripts for APIC-EM.

These examples are Python 2.

You may need to change the `APIC_USER` AND `APIC_PASSWORD` variables in the
[apic_config.py](/apic_config.py) file.  You can also change controllers here
too and point to the URL of your own APIC-EM controller.

The directory PnP contains some examples specifically for Network Plug and Play (PnP)
